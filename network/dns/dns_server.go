serveDNS
Parameters: connection - a pointer to a UDP connection object, which keeps
stateful data; clientAddress - the IP address to reply to; request - the
DNS layer data from the client, containing the question.
Returns: None

Makes a reply to the client's DNS question, but does not send it unless the
last line is commented out. Even though (by default) the DNS server does not
reply, it still needs to run in the background; otherwise, the client will
throw an error that it could not open a connection to the DNS server.
